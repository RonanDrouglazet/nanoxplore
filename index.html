          NanoXplore is a privately owned fabless company based in France. The company was created in 2010 by three veterans of
          semiconductor industry with long experience in the design, test and debugging of FPGA cores. NanoXplore is therefore a
          leader in the design of large scale programmable logic arrays for state of the art FPGA cores.

          The founders of NanoXplore were amongst the pioneers of custom FPGA based emulation systems and IP macros for embedded
          FPGA cores. In 2000,they developed the first range of IP macros to provide programmable logic cores for System on Chip (SoC) designs. In
          2006 they developed a new family of FPGA devices with 750K four-input LUTs implemented in a
          65nm technology.

              <p>As a company, we are committed to being beyond reproach to all our partners. But because we are aware of the challenges
              of today's world, we also want to be just as exemplary to society as a whole. We promote values in which we firmly
              believe as innovation that must be collaborative to be effective, thus creating an innovative dynamic that benefits
              everyone. We also want to be responsible towards our employees or partners, but also towards the environment that we are
              committed to preserving. Finally, ethics is at the heart of our concerns, from the transparency we impose on ourselves
              towards all our partners to the fight against corruption and influence peddling, we do everything we can to adopt
              socially responsible behaviour. This is why we have made commitments in terms of the environment, ethics and respect for
              our employees and partners.</p>

              employees a safe, pleasant and environmentally responsible workplace in which they can develop their skills and develop
              their careers in order to achieve both their professional and personal goals.</p>
              <b>Collaboration for innovation</b>
              <p>At NanoXplore we promote collaborative projects because we are firmly convinced that innovation and progress can only
              come from a combination of experiences and horizons. That is why we work from the beginning to the end of projects with
              our suppliers, subcontractors and customers so that everyone's know-how leads everyone to a real technological
              achievement. We also partner with university research laboratories to benefit from the latest technological advances but
              also to make our contribution. All the partnerships we develop are destined to last over time since only a real
              relationship of trust can achieve the best results. Finally, we ensure that all partners with whom we contract respect
              the values in which we believe.</p>
              <h3>Environment</h3>
              <p>We are committed to an eco-responsible approach that we want to develop as we grow. We therefore ensure that all our
              employees have the opportunity to travel to their workplace by public transport. Our employees are made aware of waste
              sorting and eco-citizen actions in their daily lives. We are also committed to recycling all our computer equipment. For
              the lighting of our premises, we have chosen low-energy LED bulbs triggered by a motion detection device to limit energy
              waste. Our head office is now located in Sèvres, a city that actively promotes the sorting and recycling of waste and

            NXboard GUI.
            The results can be displayed and analyzed either with :
            <ul>
              <li>ModelSim wafeform viewer (using a simple testbench to read the .txt file generated by NXcore generator and display the

            <p>NanoXplore has developed Radiation-Hardened By Design SRAM-based FPGA devices for use into systems operating in harsh
            environments, such as Spaceborne and Airbone applications, as well as Military and High-Energy Physics subsystems.
            <br /><br />
            By nature, SRAM-based FPGAs are volatile. NanoXplore has developed a dedicated architecture based on hardening
            techniques such as
            <ul>
            <li>Use of DICE (Dual Interlocked storage CEll) memory latch. DICE architecture has been used for Configuration Memory Cells
            and Internal registers (DFFs)</li>
            <li>Use of EDAC for BRAM blocks</li>
            <li>The Clock-tree being susceptible to SETs has been hardened according dedicated techniques,
            Use of hardened blocks from STM SKYROB library,</li>
            <li>Last but not least, use of TMR (Triple Module Redundancy) concept for all other blocks.</li>
            </ul>
            These techniques allow us to reach a very low Soft-Error Rate (*), even into the most critical orbit.
            <br/><br />
            On top of that, please note, NX RHBD FPGA devices embed a CMIC. CMIC stands for Configuration Memory Integrity Check. It
            consists of an internal scrubber controller based on a Finite State Machine with its own hardened memory block where we
            store CRC signatures. As soon as the FPGA is configured and the FPGA being ‘READY’, the CMIC will verify the integrity
            of the bitstream. The CMIC is a SECDED. All single errors will be detected, then corrected. When a double error will be
            detected, the user will be informed.<br /><br />
            (*) SER defined into NX Radiation Reports, calculated based on Heavy Ions and Protons cross sections and their relevant
            Weibull parameters.</p>

              <p>They are expressed in the daily life of all our teams:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Innovation is in NanoXplore's DNA. It is the manifestation of the company's collaborative qualities, its ability
                  to
                  communicate and its will to constantly push the limits of knowledge. It creates an innovative dynamic, from the
                  design
                  stage to customer service, through the creation of products that open new paths, and allows us to stay ahead of
                  time.</li>
                <li>
                  Responsibility: there is no innovation without team spirit, without challenges, without adventure, without a spirit
                  of
                  entrepreneurship. It is the driving force of a company which builds, above all, on trust in the individual and their
                  talents. We also take responsibility for the impact of our activity on the environment. We are particularly
                  attentive to
                  ensuring the preservation of the environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The meaning of clients: NanoXplore promotes rules of transparency and ethics which allows us to build permanent
                  relationships of trust. It includes vigilant against bribery and the trading of influence, the confidentiality and
                  protection of knowledge, and ethical commitments in accounting and financial matters.
